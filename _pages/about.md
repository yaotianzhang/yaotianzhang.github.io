你好! I'm currently a first-year Ph.D. student in the School of Journalism and Communication, at Nanjing University, advised by [Cheng-Jun Wang](https://chengjunwang.com/). I'm also a member of [Computational Communication Collaboratory](https://chengjun.github.io/socrateslab/), at Nanjing University. My interests focus on Computational Communication, Social Culture, Computational Narrative, and Causal Inference. 

I had two full-time internships at DiDi Chuxing (Data Analysis intern) and Bytedance (HRBP intern). I try my best to roll the racket and hit the tennis accurately.
