ä½ å¥½! I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Journalism and Communication, at Nanjing University, advised by [Cheng-Jun Wang](https://chengjunwang.com/). I'm also a member of [Computational Communication Collaboratory](https://chengjun.github.io/socrateslab/), at Nanjing University. 

My research focuses on **behavioral and emotional effects of social culture**. My primary research explores the following question: What motivates people to tell stories and take action? How emotions and narratives in digital media shape social reality, and what kind of feedback will social reality generate? My work has been accepted by _Internation Journal of Business Communication_ and _Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media_. My research is funded by several national and internal grants. 

I use classic computational methods like sentiment analysis, time series analysis, and machine learning, as well as causal inference method to explore relations of the key concept of social scientific theory. Currently, I am developing a new word embedding method to explore the semantic progress of interactive narrative.  

I obtained my B.A. degree from the School of Journalism at Chongqing University. I had two full-time internships at DiDi Chuxing (Data Analysis intern) and Bytedance (HRBP intern). Outside work, I try my best to roll the racket and hit the tennis accurately.
