ä½ å¥½! I'm currently a second-year Ph.D. student in the School of Journalism and Communication, at Nanjing University, advised by [Cheng-Jun Wang](https://chengjunwang.com/). I'm also a member of [Computational Communication Collaboratory](https://chengjun.github.io/socrateslab/), at Nanjing University. 

My research focuses on **behavioral and emotional effects of social culture**. My primary research explores the following questions: What is the motivation behind people taking action? How emotions and discourse in social media shape social reality, and what kind of feedback will social reality generate? My work has been accepted by _Physica A_ and _ICA Annual Conference_. My research is funded by several national and internal grants. 

I use classic computational methods like sentiment analysis, time series analysis, and machine learning, as well as causal inference method to explore relations of the key concept of social scientific theory. Currently, I am developing a new word embedding method to explore the semantic progress of interactive narrative.  

I obtained my B.A. degree from the School of Journalism at Chongqing University. I had two full-time internships at DiDi Chuxing (Data Analysis intern) and Bytedance (HRBP intern). Outside work, I try my best to roll the racket and hit the tennis accurately.
